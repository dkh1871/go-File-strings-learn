Thought on testing and checking out what is the correct method of reading and searching for text I need.
Note that the end point is to read over structured meta data that will have specific fields
    These fields should be able to map to a struct in the future
    and I will need to read into specific fields hopefully to save time

Right now I'm just playing around and getting used to the differnt tools I could use.plan for this repo.

Create several packages using differnt of opening files and text matching.
using the bench marktool check how fast this is done for single and mulitipu files without using go routines
