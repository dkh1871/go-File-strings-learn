# go-File-strings-learn  
Messing with strings and files to test out functions/Research  

The over all Goal is to try out the differn file open and text serching methods in go. For now I'm going to try to stay to the Stander Lib.   
THis is due to my normal working enviroment where I may not have access to any or all thrid party libarys.  



Project outline  -- Single treaded right now -- Routines will come latter on the best preformers 
* open a file  
* look over the file for the speicfic text  
* return its row postintion and line postion of the word  


## Notes  
* Use differnt modules for differnt process so I can test/bench mark each method
